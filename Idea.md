Unicoin - a currency for university students.
--

Potential Market.
--
Universities, MOOC platforms, private colleges.

> It is fair to presume that, as with any currency, a market will develop.

Desired output for the Blackaton.
--
At the end of the Blackaton the main output will consist of a platform through which Universities can easily create smart-contract to issue tokens to students.

Ideal team.
--
• Solidity developer
• Web developer
• UI/UX designer
at leaset one of them with a clue about security

To discuss before the Blockathon.
