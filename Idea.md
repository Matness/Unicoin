Unicoin (UUC)
===
## A currency for university students.


###  Potential Market.
Public and Private Universities, MOOC platforms, private colleges.

### How it will work.
> The issuers of Unicoins (UUC) are Universities. 
> The receivers of UUC are the University’s Students.
> Each Institution has its own UUC. For example UNSW will have UNSW Unicoins.

> Students receive an amount of coins proportional to their grades and achievement. 

> Coins can then be spent for (1) a number of activities within the University or (2) to receive discounts at the local cafeteria, local drugstore – or most likely the local booze shop or weed guy.

> Alternatively (or simultaneously) the coins can be used to apply for specific job positions and would function as both (1) a proof of achievement (if a position requires UUC.75 and a student can only ever have a total UUC.100, it would mean that they have achieved a certain amount of study) and (2) as a proof of motivation (if a student can only ever have UUC.100 and spends UUC.75 for one application, that application will be his/her only application as such). 

### Desired output for the Blackaton.
At the end of the Blackaton the main output will consist of a platform through which Universities can easily create ERC20 smart-contracts to issue their own tokens to students.

### Ideal team.
* Solidity developer
* Web developer
* UI/UX designer

(at leaset one of them with a clue about security).

## To discuss before the Blockathon.

### Potential attacks
Who would have an interest in exploiting the system?

How could the system be exploited?

### Moral and Ethical issues
Could the system be damaging for some students over others?

Could the system increase social disparities?

Could the system give too much power to institutions over students?
